# Primes 
### My little tech test environment.

### How to start
1. Clone code sources to directory `YOUR_DIR`.
2. (Optional) Open `YOUR_DIR` in your favorite IDE as gradle project.
3. Run `test` task from `YOUR_DIR/build.gradle`. That task will run all tests in all subprojects.

### Sub-project specific run
### Core console app (`/core` directory)
Run `ConsoleApp#main` method that tests on primality numbers from arguments.  
To specify numbers pass them after `-n` argument or in argument `--numbers=[comma divided numbers]`.
